h1 Timestamp Microservice
p User Stories:
ol 
    li I can pass a string as a parameter, and it will check to see whether that
    string contains either a unix timestamp or a natural language date (example:
    January 1, 2016)
    li If it does, it returns both the Unix timestamp and the natural language
    form of that date.
    li If it does not contain a date or Unix timestamp, it returns null for
    those properties.

h2 Example usage:
p
    a https://localhost:3000/December%2014,%202015
p 
    a https://localhost:3000/1450072800

h2 Example output:
p { "unix": 1450072800, "natural": "Mon Dec 14 2015" }
